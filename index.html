   <q><em>You do not have to be good.
         You do not have to walk on your knees
         for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
         You only have to let the soft animal of your body
         love what it loves.
         Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
         Meanwhile the world goes on.
         Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
         are moving across the landscapes,
         over the prairies and the deep trees,
         the mountains and the rivers.
         Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
         are heading home again.
         Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
         the world offers itself to your imagination,
         calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting â€“
         over and over announcing your place
         in the family of things.</em></q> -Mary Oliver

            <h2>Greater Roadrunner</h2>
            <p>
               "Though I was born in Amarillo, TX, my earlier memories are from the handful of years in which my family
               lived in Albuquerque. I have vague and hazy recollections of seeing these birds. But on a family vacation
               (as an adult) in 2018, my heart leapt when I saw a greater roadrunner living up to its name. The bird was
               running along a service street in the middle of the scrub and sand of New Mexico. We were traveling to
               Glorietta and <strong>I got to see one!</strong> It was pretty awesome."

            <h2>Pileated Woodpecker</h2>
            <p>
               "Woodpeckers have always fascinated me. The physics of how they can hammer their beaks into solid wood
               without concussing themselves is so cool. Our first home was by a beauitful park on the Meramec. They're
               about crow-sized (17" or so) and they sound like <em>monkeys</em> when they call out. I hope you get to
               see one!
               They're not too common in Missouri."

            <h2>Barn Owl</h2>
            <p>
               "This isn't just my favorite bird. It's my favorite animal. <strong>Period.</strong> Sadly, I have never
               seen one in the
               wild. They have a terrible call (Google it), but I think the heart-shaped face is stunning. Silent
               killers, they mostly eat rodents. Maybe the fact that there aren't that many barns left in Missouri is a
               factor in their not being very common these days."

            <h2>Eurasian Tree Sparrow</h2>
            <p>
               "Now these little guys really are fun! In the spring of 1870, a shipment of birds from Germany was
               released into St. Louis. The hope was that the sight of familiar species would be a welcome sight to
               European immigrants. And in that shipment were a dozen Eurasian Tree Sparrows! In Missouri, they're
               really only found in St. Louis (you'll also see them across the river in Illinois). The more aggressive
               House Sparrow keep their populations from gaining, but they're easily distinguished by the black spot on
               their cheeks."

            <h2>Scarlet Tanager</h2>
            <p>
               "I've only seen this bird once. It was at Lone Elk Park. With their unmistakable black and scarlet
               plumage (the females are olive-yellow), these birds are usually hard to see. They spend a lot of time in
               the treetops, but the one I saw in the park was perched on a dead tree in the middle of a clearing.
               Lovely."
